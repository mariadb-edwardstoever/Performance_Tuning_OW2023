#STEP 1 FIND USERS THAT CREATE TMP TABLES ON DISK

# VERIFY THAT status_by_user IS NOT FOR CURRENT SESSIONS ONLY. 
# RUN THIS QUERY AS ROOT, LOGOUT, LOGIN, RUN IT AGAIN
select * from performance_schema.status_by_user
where variable_name in 
('created_tmp_disk_tables','Created_tmp_files','Created_tmp_tables')
and `USER`='root';
# WE CAN SEE THAT THE STATS PERSIST BEYOND A GIVEN SESSION! GREAT!


# LOOK FOR ACCOUNTS THAT CREATE LOTS OF TEMP TABLES ON DISK
select * from performance_schema.status_by_user
where variable_name in 
('created_tmp_disk_tables','Created_tmp_files','Created_tmp_tables')
and `USER` is not null;

# WHAT ARE THESE ACCOUNTS DOING?
select sql_text from perf_schema.statements_history_long where user='maxscale' and sql_text is not null;
select sql_text from perf_schema.statements_history_long where user='app' and sql_text is not null;

# CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT THOSE ACCOUNTS WERE DOING TO SEE WHAT STATMENTS INCREASE YOUR OWN STATISTICS?
