# DISCOVERING CARDINALITY


# INDEX(flag) is almost never useful if `flag` has very few values. 
# More specifically, when you say WHERE flag = 1 and "1" occurs more 
# than 20% of the time, such an index will be shunned. The Optimizer 
# would prefer to scan the table instead of bouncing back and forth 
# between the index and the data for more than 20% of the rows.
# ("20%" is really somewhere between 10% and 30%, depending on the phase of the moon.)
